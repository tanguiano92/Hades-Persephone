    <center><p>I created “HadesxPersephone” as a therapy piece. As we know, these last few months have been extremely difficult <br>
      for everyone. However, within the past two years, I have lost thirteen family members and now with the pandemic <br> 
      causing a rift between my ability to visit family, depression and harsh thoughts have been creeping into my psyche. <br>
      While in quarantine, however, I found myself becoming more and more interested in classic Greek mythos and connecting <br>
      specific stories to my own intrigues. The connection between Life and Death has always peaked my curiousity because both <br>
      aspects are always thrown up in the air with theories and questions. No one has definitive answers for why we are here <br>
      or where we go when we are gone. Theologies try to make sense of it through sermons and beliefs, while scienctists scratch <br>
      their heads in uncertanty. Plain and simple, we are just here. Going through the same cycle of living and dying but no two <br>
      lives are lived the same way. This thought always reminds me of the tale of Hades and Persephone; essentially the king of <br> 
      the underworld and the fertility/nature Goddess coming together and becoming married prompted me to wonder about the so-called <br>
      divide between the realms of life and death. Are they truly divided? Or are they interconnected in a way that we do not <br>
      think about, or want to? Why are people so scared of the one constant we all have in common? In my studies during the making <br>
      of this small, but meaningful piece, the answer became clear: they go hand in hand in a harmonious, loving relationship. So <br>
      often, we are made to feel that we should be afraid of death and that it is such a taboo thing when in reality, we will all <br>
      meet the same fate. Death teaches us to live and live well within the way we want to. Don't waste time worrying about mundane <br>
      things. I created this piece as a reminder that life is a beautiful gift and the inevitable death that awaits me in the long <br>
      off future is not something to be feared, but just another adventure into the mysterious unknown once I'm done here.</p> <br></center>
